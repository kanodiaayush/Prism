To compile PRISM, the environment variable OSTYPE
must be set to one of: linux, solaris, cygwin,
depending on which operating system you are using.
This is not the case on your system. Please specify
the value of OSTYPE manually to make, e.g.:

  make OSTYPE=linux

Alternatively, if you wish, you can set the environment
variable yourself (using setenv or export) or you
can edit the value of OSTYPE directly in the Makefile.
