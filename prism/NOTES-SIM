NOW/NEXT
--------

DTMC with local nondet and actions (~/prism-models/dave-test.nm)

GUI transition box: "true" updates don't display correctly


TODO (before any release)
-------------------------


TODO (later)
------------

* add (back) support for loop detection (embedded into Path*?)
* add (back) early termination of sampling (thru expt stop?)

* random initial state
* variable overflow etc.
* add support for "deadlock" and "init" (new EvaluationContext, model *and* state dependent)

* explicitbuildtest doesn't handle dupes in mdps (e.g. consensus)
* seed issues (currently twice in one second = same seed)
* traviendo export?

* explicit build doesn't handle multiple initial states

BUGS (later)
------------

* approx mc of a property loses any current simulator path in gui.
  is that ok? (seems to be buggy in 3.3.1 anyway)
