Questions:

is it safe to split (refine) multiple states concurrently in the way that we do?

do we want to check for duplicate sym states when creating new ones through refinement?
 - is this safe?

are we ok to have non-diagonal c-closure algorithm?
or is it ok if only use this on initial reach graph construction?
