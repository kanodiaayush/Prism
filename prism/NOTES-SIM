TODO (before any release)
-------------------------


TODO (later)
------------

* investigate efficiency wrt old simulator

* add (back) support for full loop detection? (embedded into Path*?)
* add (back) early manual termination of sampling (thru expt stop?)

* random initial state
* variable overflow etc.
* add support for "deadlock" and "init" (new EvaluationContext, model *and* state dependent)
* seed issues (currently twice in one second = same seed)

* explicitbuildtest doesn't handle dupes in mdps (e.g. consensus)
* explicit build doesn't handle multiple initial states

* GUI sim - add context menu to transition list with e.g. "show in model"

* traviendo export?

CODE:
* Optimise/tidy Choices (ChoiceList/ChoiceSingleton/etc.)


BUGS (later)
------------

* approx mc of a property loses any current simulator path in gui.
  is that ok? (seems to be buggy in 3.3.1 anyway)
