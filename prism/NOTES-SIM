NOW/NEXT:


work on Sampler classes
need to get property constants sorted out
should be specified when passed to sim engine, like for models
but when are props passed to sim engine? diff for pathgen/sampling?
what about experiments, e.g. F<=t for t=...?


looping


TODO:

explicitbuildtest doesn't handle dupes in mdps (e.fg. consensus)

explicit build doesn't handle multiple initial states

seed issues (currently twice in one second = same seed)

traviendo export?

approx mc of a property loses any current simulator path in gui.
is that ok? (seems to be buggy in 3.3.1 anyway)

TEST CASES

[t,t'] examples sent as MRMC bug fix?

DTMC with local nondet and actions (~/prism-models/dave-test.nm)

GUI transition box: "true" updates don't display correctly
