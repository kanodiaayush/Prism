PEPA to PRISM Compiler Release 0.03.2
=====================================

This is the source code of release 0.03.2 of the PEPA to PRISM
Compiler.  This software is distributed under the GNU Public License.
Please see the file COPYING in this directory for details.

The PEPA to PRISM Compiler includes both Standard ML and Java source
code.  To recompile the compile from source requires MLj 0.1 and a
Java compiler.  The Java source code has been compiled with SUN's
J2SDK version 1.3.0 and 1.4.1-b21 but earlier or later releases should
also be able to compile these Java classes.  The Java reflection API
is used so it must be available with your Java compiler.

To recompile,type:
   
        (make; cd JAVA; make)

Please contact Stephen Gilmore (Stephen.Gilmore@ed.ac.uk) if you have
difficulty in compiling or using the PEPA to PRISM Compiler.  However,
please note that it is supplied without any warranty.  The latest
release of any of the PEPA modelling tools can always be obtained from
the WWW page http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/pepa

Using the compiler
==================

To run the compiler on a small input file type 

  java -cp JAVA:pepa.zip pepa.compiler.Main TESTS/small.pepa 

where the contents of the file TESTS/small.pepa are

  r = 1.0;
  t = 1.56;

  P = (a, r).P2;
  P2 = (b, t).P;

  P <> P

If you would like to know how the input PEPA components are mapped to
PRISM MTBDD variables you can request the compiler to record
information about this extraction process by creating a file named
".pepa_compiler_log_true" in the current working directory.  The file
may be empty.

To get verbose diagnostic information about the compilation process
create a file called ".pepa_compiler_debug_true" in the current
working directory.  The file may be empty.
