PRISM was unable to find the directory which contains
your Java distribution. Please specify this manually to
make as in the following example:

  make JAVA_DIR=/usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2

If you don't know where your Java distribution is, try typing:

  which javac

If the output is of the form 'javac: Command not found' or
'which: no javaccc in...' then either you don't have Java
installed or your path is not set up to include Java.
If the output is something like:

  /bham/java/packages/j2sdk1.4.2/bin/javac

then the directory is /usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2
(i.e. with the '/bin/javac' removed).
One situation where this doesn't work is when javac
has been set up as a symbolic link. In this case, type:

  ls -l `which javac`

which will tell you where javac actually is (the part displayed
after the -> arrow. You can then deduce what the directory is as above.
