Brief notes on support for PTAs in PRISM
----------------------------------------

* The PRISM Language

In short, there is a new datatype "clock", which can be used in guards and reset (to zero) just like a normal PRISM variable. The only other addition is an "invariant" keyword, used to specify clock invariants for each PRISM module.

There are a set of PRISM PTA examples in the directory examples/pta.

* Properties

Properties are specified in PCTL, i.e. essentially we allow unbounded or time-bounded reachability properties. See the .pctl files include with the examples for some sample properties.

* Running PRISM

Temporarily, PTA support is only available through the command-line version of PRISM. See the formats09.sh script in the examples/pta directory for details of how to run the examples. Currently, there are two different engines for verifying PTAs: (1) "abstraction-refinement", as described in [KNP09c]; and (2) "digital clocks", as described in [KNPS06]. The default is (1). The digital clocks engine can be enabled using the switch "-ptamethod digital". Note, though, that this does not yet support time-bounded reachability properties.
