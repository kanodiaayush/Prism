NOW/NEXT
--------

add path manip methods - autochoice, backtrack etc.
but need to sort out loop detection first?
embedded into Path*?


TODO (before any release)
-------------------------

* variable overflow?

TODO (later)
------------

* random initial state

* explicitbuildtest doesn't handle dupes in mdps (e.g. consensus)
* seed issues (currently twice in one second = same seed)
* traviendo export?

add support for "deadlock" and "init" (new EvaluationContext, model *and* state dependent)

approx mc of a property loses any current simulator path in gui.
is that ok? (seems to be buggy in 3.3.1 anyway)
