This case study is based on the bounded retransmission protocol (BRP) [HSV94], a variant of the alternating bit protocol.

Its parameters are:

  N = number of chunks in a file
  MAX = maximum number of retransmissions
  TD = the transition delay
  TIME_OUT = the time the sender waits before timing out

TIME_OUT should be greater than the time to send and receive an ack (i.e. greater than 2*TD)

For more information, see the untimed version: http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/casestudies/brp.php

The PTA extension is based on that used in [HH09]
