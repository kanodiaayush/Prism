Todo
----

* Clarify semantic/type checks (consistency with games/digital)

* Clarify time divergence issues

* Sort VarList (two types - before and after constants evaluated). Need for simulator too.

* Digital clocks: No time-bounded until yet
* Digital clocks: Translation done sep for each property (e.g. for cmax)?

* BRP example


Maybe todo
----------

* Games: Optimise number of states in time-bounded PTAs
  (extras added in old target states) using until in forwards reach?

* Fix: Creation of new names (adding extra _s) doesn't take into account prop file ot consts etc.

* Digital clocks: urgency?

* Digital clocks: optimisations?


Tidy
----

* Remove unneeded files from examples (prism-benchmark, rewards stuff)


Documentation
-------------

Where can clocks be used
* clock constraints (just (some) binops)
  - in guards
  - in invariants
* resets (normal updates, but to ints only)
* var decl.s
* generally must be convex (i.e. just conj of constraints) (can be relaxed a bit for digital clocks)

Must have single initial state (is this true for digital clocks too?)
