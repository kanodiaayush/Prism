* NOTES

=======================================================

TODO (before any release)
-------------------------

PTAs:
* GUI
* (Further) tidy of prism-examples/pta
* Clarify semantic/type checks (consistency with games/digital)
* Check guards/invariants for convexity (for now, neither can be non-convex, see below)
* Clarify time divergence issues
* non-zeno checks?
* Sort VarList (two types - before and after constants evaluated). Need for simulator too.

=======================================================

TODO (before public release)
----------------------------

Filters, property semantics, etc.
* Integer-valued props displayed as doubles - need to give types to StateValues?
  - lots of other places too e.g. GUI results)
* Intervals for multiple initial states
  - Need classes for Result
  - Graph plotting?
* Restructure Result class? e.g. separate bracketed comment? (done I think)
  - Errors (Exceptions) formatted properly?

PTAs:
* Enforce well-formedness checks (i.e. guards/resets imply target invariants)
  (as opposed to say supporting strong invariants,
   where targets with false invariants cannot be entered)
  - zone-based: check during reach using valids
    (or just during FW reach?) (nb: need to split dpost to do check)
    (see non-well-formed.nm/pctl for a test case)
    (if can't do that, syntax check using sat)
  - digital clocks: check invariants after transform/reach?
* Digital clocks: No time-bounded until yet
* Digital clocks: Translation done sep for each property (e.g. for cmax)?
* Bug fix: action alphabet (syntactic) for sync lost in PTA object construction

DOC (before public release)
---------------------------

Filters:
* Filters - no longer allowed minmax (or encode as range?)
* P>=p[...{filter}] means & not print (didn't print in 3.3 anyway, despite manual)

PTAs:
* Where can clocks be used
 - clock constraints (just (some) binops)
  - in guards
  - in invariants
 - resets (normal updates, but to ints only)
 - var decl.s
 - generally must be convex (i.e. just conj of constraints) (can be relaxed a bit for digital clocks)
* Currently, modules cannot access non-local vars (and there are no globals)
  (this is too restrictive, e.g. for message passing)
* Must have single initial state (is this true for digital clocks too?)
* Invariants must come straight after var decls

=======================================================

BUG (some time)
---------------

Simulator:
* approx mc of a property loses any current simulator path in gui.
  is that ok? (seems to be buggy in 3.3.1 anyway)

* prism ~/prism-examples/dice/dice.pm \
-pctl '(s=0|s=1)=>P>=1 [ (P>=0.9 [ F<=1 s=3 ])=>(P>=0.5 [ F<=2 s=4 ]) ]'
(time-bounds should be ok in inner pctl but are not)

TODO (some time)
----------------

PTAs:
* On-the-fly global reachability to allow (for A-R engine):
  - access to other local and global vars
  - system endsystem?
 (then test on Arnd's BRP model + others)
* BRP example
* Translate non-convex guards to DNF and multiple transitions
* Investigate whether non-convex invariants can be supported (look at zone ops)
* BRP example

* Games: Optimise number of states in time-bounded PTAs
  (extras added in old target states) using until in forwards reach?
* Fix: Creation of new names (adding extra _s) doesn't take into account prop file ot consts etc.
* Digital clocks: urgency?
* Digital clocks: optimisations?

* New version of valid2 (inv/g push outside)
* Combined complement + intersection (terminating early) for when dbm lists get big
* Are we ok to have non-diagonal c-closure algorithm?
  (or is it ok if only use this on initial reach graph construction?)

Simulator:
* Investigate efficiency wrt old simulator
* Add (back) support for *full* loop detection? (not just *single* self-loops)
* Add (back) early manual termination of sampling (thru expt stop?)
* Random initial state
* Variable overflow etc.
* Add support for "deadlock" and "init" (new EvaluationContext, model *and* state dependent)
* Seed issues (currently twice in one second = same seed)
* explicitbuildtest doesn't handle dupes in mdps (e.g. consensus)
* Explicit build doesn't handle multiple initial states
* GUI sim - add context menu to transition list with e.g. "show in model"
* Traviendo export?
* Code: Optimise/tidy Choices (ChoiceList/ChoiceSingleton/etc.)

Actions:
* Finalise tra format with actions (needs to work with MCs too)
  - also fix e.g. importtrans, prism-statra
* make action storage optional (when required e.g. for export) (especially for MCs)

Adversary generation:
* Add adversary generation for other engines

Abstraction/refinement:
* Exp reach for games
* Poss. refine opt: don't add ubsets of player1 choices

BSCC stuff:
* regression testing + perf. on ltl stuff with 3 diff options

Code tidy:
* remove colons from @params

DOC (some time)
---------------

Prism-multi:
* No state rewards
